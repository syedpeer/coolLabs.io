# coolCode - in development

## About
A cool browser based code editor environment.

## Features
- Code your backend with Node.js, Python, Golang...
- Code your frontend with Vue.js, Angular, React.js, Vanilla...
- Attach the required services:
    - Database, like Mongodb or PostgreSQL
    - Server log analytics, like Timber.io
    - User analytics, like Google Analytics
    - User error tracking, like Track.js
- And deploy your containerized application to Docker Swarm or Kubernetes with one click!

### All features are developed in house. Why?

Most of the services mentioned as example, are pretty good, but in most cases there is a catch, eg: price / privacy.

We have no such thing.
