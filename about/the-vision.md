applications & services for you!

## Lightning Fast ⚡
All of our applications are [Progressive Web Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications), which makes them a lot faster, reliable and delivers the same user experience on any platforms. It also help us to deliver new features and fixes faster and cooler.

## Alternative 👋
One of our main focus is to create a [place](/webapps/upcoming/coolbox.html) where you can find all of your essential and everyday applications without any data concerns.

::: danger Did you know?
That most of the applications you are using are in the hand of [~5 companies](https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-the-big-five-tech-giants-from-my-life-it-was-hel-1831304194), directly or indirectly?
And you are giving them your personal data in exchange when you are using them?

    That's why we are working hard to give you an alternative of these applications!

## Open Sourced ✌️
We ❤️️ open source, so we are publising as much of our code as possible.

## Secure 🔐
Security is a serious thing, so we take it seriously!

## Data Protected 💾
The data we collect is only used to improve the application itself. 

We never sell it to any 3rd party - that is not our business model.

## Coollaborative 🗣

Every user could and should shape our applications to make them perfect! [Contact us anytime](/contact/) if you have any idea.

## Pretty Cool 👌

Our apps cool, pretty cool, that's it 😎.
