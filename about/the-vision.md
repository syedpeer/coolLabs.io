# The Vision ðŸš€

Our vision is to make:
- [Lightning Fast](#lightning-fast)
- [Secure](#secure)
- [Data Protected](#data-protected)
- [Coollaborative](#coollaborative)
- [Alternative to 'big five'](#alternative-to-big-five)
- and [Cool](#cool)

applications / services for you, to have an option to choose!

## Lightning Fast
All of our applications are [Progressive Web Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications), which makes them a lot faster, reliable and it can be used on any platform independently, like a native application. That's why the development process is way easier/faster than making separate application for each platform.

## Secure
Security best practices are applied to all of our applications.

## Data Protected
The data we collect is only used to improve the application itself. 

We never sell it to any 3rd party - that is not our business model.

## Coollaborative
Everybody could have a cool idea, we are open to [discuss it!](/contact/)
## TODO HERE:D


## Alternative to 'big five'
> Did you know that most of the apps you are using are in the hand of the [big five](https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-the-big-five-tech-giants-from-my-life-it-was-hel-1831304194) directly or indirectly? 

You are giving your data for free to Amazon, Google or Microsoft when you are using your favourite daily application.

<div class="text-center py-10 font-bold">
    We are working hard to give you an alternative of those applications to choose from with similar user experience but without data concerns.
</div>

## Cool

Our applications are just cool, that's it ðŸ˜Ž.
