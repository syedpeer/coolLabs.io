# About us üë•

## Transparent applications

Our applications & services are independent of the [big five](https://gizmodo.com/c/goodbye-big-five) or any other 3rd parties. 

<br/>

**We code everything with our bare hands** in [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) style.

<br/>

You could say - _**it does not sounds very productive**_ - and you are probably right. We could integrate already available services easier and we could publish our applications way faster, but that is not why we are doing this.

### Then why?
Imagine if you do not need to think about how your data is handled and secured!

::: tip
With our products you could sit back & relax. There is no hidden things.

**Besides, we ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è learning & coding, so why not? :metal:**

Just 2 developers from üá≠üá∫ with a simple [mission](/).
