# About us üë•

## Transparent applications

Our applications & services are independent of the [big five](https://gizmodo.com/c/goodbye-big-five) or any other 3rd parties.

<br/>

**We code everything with our bare hands** in [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) style.

### Why?
Imagine for a moment that you do not need to think where your data is flowing while using an application, how it will be used, what would be sold to some 3rd parties?
Sounds cool?

::: tip
With our products you could sit back & relax. There is no hidden things.

In the other hand, we ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è learning & coding, so why not? :metal:
